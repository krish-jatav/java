// What is Java?

// Ans => Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed
// by Sun Microsystems
// (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It was designed with the
// principle of
// "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java programs can run on any
// device that has
// a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware
// and software platform.

// Key features of Java include:

// Platform Independence: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can be
// executed on any platform with a JVM. This allows Java applications to be
// highly portable.

// Object-Oriented: Java follows an object-oriented programming paradigm,
// supporting concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and
// encapsulation.

// Robustness: Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and type
// checking mechanisms, which help in creating reliable and robust applications.

// Security: Java has built-in security features such as bytecode verification
// and a security manager to protect systems from malicious code.

// Multithreading: Java supports multithreading, allowing programs to perform
// multiple tasks concurrently, making it suitable for developing scalable and
// high-performance applications.

// Rich Standard Library: Java comes with a rich set of standard libraries (Java
// API) that provide support for various tasks such as I/O operations,
// networking, GUI development, and more.

// Automatic Garbage Collection: Java's automatic garbage collection mechanism
// manages memory allocation and deallocation, making memory management easier
// for developers.

//QUE => What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?

// Ans=>

// JDK (Java Development Kit) is used for Java development and includes tools
// needed for compiling,
// debugging, and running Java programs.
// JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is used for running Java applications and includes the JVM and core
// libraries but lacks development tools.
// JVM JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract computing machine responsible for executing Java bytecode
// on various platforms, providing platform independence for Java programs.
