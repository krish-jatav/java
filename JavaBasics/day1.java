// What is Java?

//Ans => Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems
// (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It was designed with the principle of
// "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java programs can run on any device that has
// a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware and software platform.
